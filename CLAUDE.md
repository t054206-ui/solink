# Solink — working conventions for Claude Code

@AGENTS.md

- Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before changing structure. `src/lib/config/placeholders.ts` is the registry of undecided values — never replace a placeholder with an invented value.
- Every user-facing metric must be a `Classified` value rendered with `DataBadge`/`Metric`. Demo data must show `DemoBanner`.
- Secrets: server-only, via `serverEnv()`; never in client components or `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.
- Calculations live in `src/lib/solar/calculations.ts` and take all assumptions as parameters.
- AI calls go only through `src/lib/ai/claude.ts`; context comes from `src/lib/ai/context.ts`.
- Data access goes through `src/lib/data/repositories.ts` (Supabase or labeled demo).
- Do not present demo/simulated data as real. Do not add fake live features.
- Check `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run lint` before finishing.
